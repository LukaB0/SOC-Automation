# SOC Automation Lab

## Objective

The SOC Automation Lab project aimed to gain experience setting up a controlled environment for simualting and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to streamline incident response processes and enhance threat detection capabilities through the implementation of automated workflows and tools. This initiative aims to reduce manual intervention, increase efficiency, and bolster the overall security posture of digital assets. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
